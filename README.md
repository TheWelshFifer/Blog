# Introduction
Having worked as an IT Administrator for the last 20+ years, I have finally decided to start documenting some tech notes that I need to refer to and if this will help out others, great!

I will, over time, add some tech notes, tutorials and links on various technology but as I work predominately with Microsoft technology there will be a focus on the following;

#### Windows Server

#### Hyper-V

#### SCCM

#### VMM

#### Active Directory

#### PowerShell
